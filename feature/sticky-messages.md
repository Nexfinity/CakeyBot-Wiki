# Overview
Sticky messages are a feature that ensures important information remains visible at the bottom of a channel, regardless of new messages being sent. When enabled, the bot will automatically re-post the designated sticky message whenever new messages are added to the chat, maintaining its visibility. This is particularly useful for announcements, server rules, or critical updates that need constant attention. Users can set or update the sticky message content through simple bot commands, making it easy to keep the community informed and organized.
