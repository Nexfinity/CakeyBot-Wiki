# Overview
The auto message feature allows server owners to schedule recurring daily messages that are automatically sent to a specified channel at a designated time. These messages can be simple text or enhanced with a custom Discord embed, making them versatile for announcements, reminders, or community engagement. The feature includes options to enable or disable messages, ensuring flexibility based on the server's needs. Messages are sent reliably at the set time each day, helping server owners maintain consistent communication with their members.
