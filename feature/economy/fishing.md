## Overview
The `/eco fishing` command lets users try their luck at catching fish and earning money in return. It's a simple yet fun minigame that adds variety to the economy system.

### How It Works
When a user runs `/eco fishing`, the system randomly determines the outcome:
 * Success: The user catches a fish and earns a reward based on that fish's rarity.
 * Failure: The user experiences a humorous or unfortunate fishing event (e.g., the line snaps or they reel in an old boot).

### Fish Rarity Table
There are 10 different types of fish to catch, each with its own rarity and reward range. The rarer the fish, the more valuable it is—but the harder it is to catch!
