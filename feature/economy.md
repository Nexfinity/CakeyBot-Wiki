# Earn Money
## RNG Games
There's several games that rely entirely on RNG/randomization to determine the outcome. These games tend to have the highest risk-to-reward ratio and are usually more pfoitable. they can also be played entirely solo so you don't have to wait on other users to play. These games include:
* **/eco coinflip** - Guess the result to win 50% of your bet.
  * There's a 0.02% chance for the coin to land on it's side. If this occurs, the player wins 2x their bety regardless of their guess.
* **/eco guess** - Guess the number (1-10) for a chance to gain 2x-3x the amount.
  * You also get 2x if you are +/- 1 off from the correct answer instead of 3x.

## Player VS Player Games
There's also several games that allow you to directly challange other users in the server. These tend to be a little less profitable than RNG games but can introduce a new level of competition and fun among the players. These games include:
* **/eco rock-paper-scissors** - Challenge another user to Rock, Paper, Scissors.
* **/eco split-or-steal** - Challenge another user to split or steal.

## Other
Cakey Bot also includes several other ways to earn money that do not include any games, though some of them still include a certain level of RNG that can affect the profits. These commands include:
