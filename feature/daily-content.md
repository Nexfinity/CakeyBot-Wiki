# Overview
Cakey Bot's Daily Content feature allows servers to automatically receive fun and engaging daily updates at noon in their server. With a variety of images and facts to choose from, this feature adds a touch of entertainment and curiosity to your server. Whether it’s adorable animal pictures or fascinating facts, you can customize the type of content delivered to suit your community’s interests.

> **Fun Fact:** You can change Cakey Bot's timezone on the dashboard so the content always announces at noon in your timezone!
