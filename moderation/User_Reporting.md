# Overview

The User Reporting feature allows users to report users or messages that they find inappropriate or offensive. This feature is particularly useful for Discord servers with a large number of users, as it allows for a more efficient way of moderating content. It also helps to create a safer and more welcoming environment for all users.
Overall, the User Reporting feature in Cakey Bot is a valuable tool for maintaining a positive and respectful community on Discord.

# What do the staff see?

The staff are prompted with an embed where they can take action. First, they will have both the ID of the user who sent the message and the ID of user who reported the message. They will also have the time that the message was sent as well as a link to jump to the message. The embed will also include the message content if it's available (For embeds it will try to grab the embed's description if there is one.)

The embed will also include these punishment actions: 
* Delete the message
* Warn the user
* Timeout the user for 24h
* Delete the Report
