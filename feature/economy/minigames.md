## Minefield
When you run `/eco minefield`, a 4x4 grid of hidden tiles appears. Some of these tiles hide bombs, while the rest are safe. Your goal is to reveal as many safe tiles as possible to increase your reward â€” but beware: revealing a bomb ends the game and you lose everything!

Each time you click a tile:
* âœ… A safe tile increases your potential payout.
* ðŸ’£ A bomb ends the round with no reward.

You can choose to cash out at any time to lock in your earnings before hitting a bomb.

## High or Low

When you run `/eco high-or-low`, Your goal is to guess whether the number will be **higher** or **lower** than **5**.

Each correct guess advances you to the next stage and increases your potential winnings. But beware â€” one wrong guess, and you lose **everything**!

At any point, you can choose to **cash out** and claim your current winnings instead of risking the next guess.

Each stage:

* ðŸ”¼ Guess **High** if you think the next number will be higher.
* ðŸ”½ Guess **Low** if you think it will be lower.
* ðŸ’° **Cash Out** to lock in your winnings before you guess wrong.

The further you go, the more you earn â€” but one mistake resets it all!
