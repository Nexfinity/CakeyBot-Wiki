# Overview

> Cakey Bot's chat bot makes use of OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, meaning that every single message and response costs us money. As such, the AI chat bot requests will be locked behind premium. (Excluding trial limits for non-premium servers)
{.is-warning}

Cakey Bot has a built-in AI chatbot that can generate semi-realistic conversations and responses to various questions and prompts. To interact with the AI you must directly ping/mention Cakey Bot then include your question/message after that mention. Cakey bot will then generate a response and reply to you.

# Try It Out

All servers start with 20 FREE requests every month! After that you will have to purchase premium to play with it further or you can give it a try by talking to it in the [#ai-chat-bot](https://discord.com/channels/408424043482447872/1016061990613041202) channel on our [Support Discord](https://cakey.bot/discord) for FREE.

# Setup

To setup Cakey Bot's chat AI simply follow these steps:

1. Login to the web dashboard on the [main website here](https://cakey.bot/dashboard/public).
2. Click on the server you want to enable the chat bot on.
3. Go to the "Bot Settings/Core" page.
4. Toggle the "Enable AI Chat Bot" setting to on.
5. You can now mention and interact with Cakey Bot in your server. You can also optionally lock Cakey Bot to a specific channel as well.

> Be warned that these are all AI generated responses, as such they can possibly reply with inappropriate or unexpected messages. OpenAI has many measures in place to prevent this and Cakey Bot has a custom-built censoring filter for responses. However, some replies may slip past these safe-guards. By enabling the AI chat bot, you accept that you understand this.

# Accents
Cakey Bot's Chat Bot AI can also respond to you in different languages/accents! By default all responses will be in regular English, however you can head over to our [web dashboard](https://cakey.bot/dashboard/public/) and change the "Chat Bot Accent" on our "Bot Settings" page. We currently support these accents:

* Emoticon language - using emoticons or emojis to convey emotions or reactions.
* Witty language - using puns, wordplay, or humorous expressions to entertain and engage users.

# Request Limit

Since every request made to OpenAI costs Cakey Bot money we will include limits on the number of requests you can make to the bot each month. Every message sent to the bot is equal to a single request. You can also buy higher limits than this if you need to. You can view a detailed list of limits below:
* Non-Premium: 20 Request/month
* Premium: 500 Request/month
* Custom Bot: 750 Request/month
  * Custom Bot servers also have the option to use their own custom API key instead
