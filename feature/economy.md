# Overview
The economy system offers a dynamic and customizable experience that fosters engagement and competition among server members. Users can earn currency through commands like `/eco beg`, `/eco work`, and mini-games such as `/eco coinflip`, `/eco high-or-low`, and `/eco guess`, while also competing for the top spot on the leaderboard with `/eco leaderboard`. 

They can spend or trade their wealth using `/eco shop`, `/eco pay`, and `/eco donate`, or take risks with commands like `/eco rob` and `/eco split-or-steal`. The system is highly configurable, allowing server owners to personalize settings such as the currency symbol and its position, number formatting, initial and max balances, the ability to transfer balances, and whether user balances are wiped when they leave the server. 

This combination of commands and customization options makes the economy system a versatile feature that adds excitement and interaction to any community.

## Popular Features
The Economy System offers multiple ways for users to interact with the virtual economy:

* **Currency Management:** Check balances, view leaderboards, and transfer funds
* **Earning Methods:** Work, beg, or rob other users for currency
* **Games & Gambling:** Play games of chance or challenge other users
* **Item Shop:** Purchase items that provide benefits or unlock roles
* **Boosts:** Apply multipliers to increase earnings
* **Customization:** Configure currency symbol, initial balances, and other server-specific settings

# Earn Money
## Solo Betting Games
There's several games that rely entirely on RNG/randomization to determine the outcome. These games tend to have the highest risk-to-reward ratio and are usually more profitable. They can also be played entirely solo so you don't have to wait on other users to play. These games include:
* **/eco coinflip** - Guess the result to win 50% of your bet.
  * There's a 0.02% chance for the coin to land on it's side. If this occurs, the player wins 2x their bety regardless of their guess.
* **/eco guess** - Guess the number (1-10) for a chance to gain 3x the amount.
  * You also get 2x if you are +/- 1 off from the correct answer instead of 3x.

## Player VS Player Games
There's also several games that allow you to directly challenge other users in the server. These tend to be a little less profitable than RNG games but can introduce a new level of competition and fun among the players. These games include:
* **/eco rock-paper-scissors** - Challenge another user to Rock, Paper, Scissors.
* **/eco split-or-steal** - Challenge another user to split or steal.

> The system includes safeguards against collusion in PvP games, such as prize modifiers based on player history in `/eco split-or-steal`.

## Fishing
The `/eco fishing` command lets users try their luck at catching fish and earning money in return. It's a simple yet fun minigame that adds variety to the economy system.

### How It Works
When a user runs `/eco fishing`, the system randomly determines the outcome:
 * Success: The user catches a fish and earns a reward based on that fish's rarity.
 * Failure: The user experiences a humorous or unfortunate fishing event (e.g., the line snaps or they reel in an old boot).

### Fish Rarity Table
There are 10 different types of fish to catch, each with its own rarity and reward range. The rarer the fish, the more valuable it isâ€”but the harder it is to catch!

| Fish Name           | Rarity     | Chance % | Value Range     |
|---------------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Common Carp         | Common     | 25%      | 100â€“250         |
| Rusty Trout         | Common     | 20%      | 150â€“300         |
| Speckled Bass       | Uncommon   | 15%      | 300â€“500         |
| Bluegill Perch      | Uncommon   | 10%      | 400â€“650         |
| Electric Eel        | Rare       | 8%       | 700â€“1,000       |
| Golden Salmon       | Rare       | 6%       | 1,000â€“1,500     |
| Vampire Catfish     | Epic       | 4%       | 1,500â€“2,000     |
| Phantom Ray         | Epic       | 3%       | 2,000â€“3,000     |
| Crystal Koi         | Legendary  | 2.5%     | 3,000â€“4,000     |
| Mythic Leviathan    | Mythical   | 1.5%     | 5,000â€“10,000    |

## Minefield
When you run `/eco minefield`, a 4x4 grid of hidden tiles appears. Some of these tiles hide bombs, while the rest are safe. Your goal is to reveal as many safe tiles as possible to increase your reward â€” but beware: revealing a bomb ends the game and you lose everything!

Each time you click a tile:
* âœ… A safe tile increases your potential payout.
* ðŸ’£ A bomb ends the round with no reward.

You can choose to cash out at any time to lock in your earnings before hitting a bomb.

## Other
Cakey Bot also includes several other ways to earn money that do not include any games, though some of them still include a certain level of RNG that can affect the profits. These commands include:
* **/eco work** - Work for money.
* **/eco rob** - Attempt to rob another user.
* **/eco beg** - Beg for money.

| Initial Balance             | The starting balance for new users. Also used during resets with `/ecoadmin reset-economy`.                                                                                                                        | 100                 | 0         | 1,000,000,000 | No               |

# Item Shop
The item shop allows server owners to create a customizable list of purchasable items for their members. These items can include role unlocks, which grant users specific roles upon purchase, and leveling XP to help them progress faster in the server's leveling system. Each item can have its own unique cost, making it easy to design a diverse economy tailored to your server's needs.

> Economy boosts marked as "purchasable" will also display in this shop list.
{.is-info}

## Usage
There's several commands that are used to view, buy and sell items in Cakey Bot. You can see all of the commands below:
* **/eco shop** - Purchase items from the shop for bonuses. 
* **/eco iteminfo** - View information about a specific item.
* **/eco items** - View all of the items you or someone else owns.

## Item Types
This is the list of support item types that you can configure for users to purchase:
* **Leveling XP:** Grants a specified amount of XP in the Leveling System.
* **Role Unlocks:** Grants permanent access to specified Discord roles.
* **Temporary Role Unlocks:** Grants time-limited access to roles. (specified in hours)
* **Economy Boosts:** Enhances earning rates for specified periods. (Created on separate "Boosts" page.)

## Configuration
* **Cost:** The cost for the user to purchase the item. Note: This only applies if `IsPurchasable` is enabled for the item.
* **Type:** The type of item for the user to unlock/buy.
* **Data:** The `Data` field is the amount of XP to give the user OR the ID of the role to grant. Depending on the "Type" selected.
* **Secondary Data:** The `Secondary Data` field is only used when "Temporary Role" type is selected. It is the _**number of hours**_ for the bot to grant the role to the user.
  
> **Note:** The _type_ of data placed into the `Data` and `Secondary Data` fields will change depending on the `Type` selected. Keep this in mind when creating and modifying items.
{.is-warning}

# Boosts
Boosts allow server owners to create multipliers that users can activate to enhance their earnings in the server's economy. Boosts can stack, meaning users can apply multiple boosts at once for greater rewards. These multipliers only apply to certain commands, such as games, and do not affect direct money modifications like `/pay` or `/donate`. In multiplayer scenarios, boosts are applied to the winnings received by the boosted player, but losses incurred by other players remain unaffected.

## Configuration
* **Duration:** This is how long the boost is active for once purchased. The time is based in hours.
* **Multiplier:** This is how much the boost affects earnings. Keep in mind that boosts can stack with other boosts.
* **Cost:** The cost for the user to purchase the boost. Note: This only applies if `IsPurchasable` is enabled for the boost.
* **IsPurchasable:** When this is enabled, it allows the boost to be purchased in the `/eco shop`. Otherwise users are unable to aquire the boost.

## Notes Regarding Functionality:
* Multiple boosts can be stacked/applied at once.
* Multipliers will only be applied to users who have active boosts (in regards to multi-player games).
* Commands that directly modify money such as `/pay`, `/donate` and `/ecoadmin manage-money` will **NOT** have boosts applied at all.
* When games take money from one player and give it to another, only the amount given to the winner will have boosts applied. The money _taken_ will **NOT** have a multiplier.
  * For example, assume player A has a 2x boost. If player A robs player B successfully, and the resulting amount is `$100`, then player A will receive `$200` (due to the boost), however, player B will only lose `$100` their loss will **NOT** be multiplied/boosted.
  * When this occurs, the success message will display/show the boosted amount, however, it will still only take the non-boosted amount from the loser.

> **Fun Fact:** Multiple boosts will automatically stack, allowing users to purchase multiple boosts and gain even more money!

# Anti-Abuse Mechanics
> Note: Details are intentionally limited for this in order to make it more difficult for malicious actors trying to abuse the economy system. Also not all anti-abuse mechanics may be listed.
{.is-info}

To help maintain balance and fairness in the economy, Cakey Bot includes several anti-abuse measures across money transfer actions including (but not limited to) `/rob` and `/pay`. These checks are designed to discourage spammy or predatory behavior and ensure a fun experience for everyone. These limits help prevent users from exploiting alts or friends to quickly boost their balance unfairly.

## All Economy Commands
All economy commands will have some sort of rate-limit for each command. These generic rate limits are always within a **randomized** time period (to help prevent botting/automatic abuse) and may be linked to a specific user or the entire server.

## Rob Command Protections
The `/rob` command also includes several layered checks:
* Robbing Limit â€“ Prevents users from robbing too many people in a random time frame.
* Target Saturation â€“ Protects users from being robbed excessively over a period of time.
* Pair Abuse Prevention â€“ Detects frequent rob attempts between the same two users within a random amount of time.

## Pay Command Protections
The `/pay` command also has some additional checks to curb farming and funneling:
* Sender Limit â€“ Users cannot send payments to others too frequently.
* Receiver Limit â€“ Users cannot receive too many payments within a random period of time.
