# Overview

Cakey Bot is a highly customizable utility and moderation bot. You can configure many features and settings in Cakey Bot using our web dashboard. You can access our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakey.bot/dashboard/public) or by clicking "Manage Servers" in the navigation bar of our website.

Once you have selected a server to manage, you will be taken to that server's home page. This page will show you general server stats and some basic bot settings like the default music volume, language, and command prefix. After you are on this page, you can either modify these settings or navigate to other modules to configure.
