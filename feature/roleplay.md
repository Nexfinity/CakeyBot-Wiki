# Overview
The roleplay system adds a fun and expressive layer to your server by enabling users to interact with one another using animated GIFs and themed messages. Whether you're feeling affectionate, playful, dramatic, or silly, there's a command to match the mood — from `/rp hug` and `/rp cuddle` to `/rp slap` and `/rp facepalm`.

These commands are designed to enhance social interaction and encourage lighthearted engagement between server members. Most actions are directed at another user (e.g., `/rp pat <user>` or `/rp bonk <user>`), while others trigger a random reaction without a target, such as `/rp cry` or `/rp pout`.

Each command sends a relevant GIF alongside matching text, making conversations more dynamic and visually entertaining. With no permissions required, anyone can jump in and enjoy the roleplay experience, making it a great way to build community bonds and create memorable moments.
