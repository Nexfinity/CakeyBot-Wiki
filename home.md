## Wildcard Permissions:

> It is not recommended to freely give out Administrator permission. It would just make setting up the bot simpler. Cakey Bot has many built-in safeguards to prevent the bot from being abused by users if the bot has Administrator so it is safe to grant, just not a recommended practice to do so.
{.is-warning}

# Slash Commands

Cakey Bot makes use of Discord's slash command system. Slash commands will prompt you for arguments/parameters if they are required and some will send "ephemerally", meaning that the results are only shown to you. This means that you can use some slash commands without spamming the chat for everyone else! You can find a full list of our available commands on our [website here](https://cakeybot.app/commands.html).

# Per-Server Settings (Web Dashboard)

> You will need **`Manage Server`** or **`Administrator`** permission to customize Cakey Bot in your server.
{.is-warning}

After you invite Cakey Bot, most commands/features will work right out of the box (assuming it has the correct permissions). However, there are some more advanced features that you can enable. Some of these features include but are not limited to: multiple languages, auto moderation, auto responders, audit logging, etc.

You can access the web dashboard [here](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public). All of Cakey Bot's most advanced features can be configured through the web dashboard.

and more!

# Custom Bot/Self-Hosting
