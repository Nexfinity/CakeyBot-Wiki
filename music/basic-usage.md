# Basic Usage

> In order to use music Cakey Bot will need **`Connect`** and **`Speak`** permissions for any voice channels you want to listen to music in.
{.is-warning}

# Overview

Cakey Bot can play music from multiple sources which you can view a full list of [here](https://wiki.cakey.bot/en/music/supported-sources). In order to listen to music you will need to follow the steps below.

1. Join a voice channel that Cakey bot has access to join/speak in
2. Type `/play <song>` (The `/play` command will auto-summon Cakey Bot)
   1. You can also use the `/move` command if no one else is using the bot
3. If you typed !join or !move in step two you will now need to type !play \<song> in order to start playing a song

If no song is currently playing when you add one, it will start to play instantly. If a song is currently playing, your song will be added to a queue that will play through automatically.

> If you play a live stream, other songs in the queue will not be played until either the live stream ends or until someone skips the live stream.

# Requirements

Cakey Bot requires at least **`Connect`** and **`Speak`** permissions to function. You will also need to be in a voice channel to summon Cakey Bot to it. If Cakey Bot is currently being used by users in another channel you will not be able to summon it to your channel. Many commands in Cakey Bot excluding `/dc` require a song to be playing in order to be used. If a song is not playing an error message will be displayed. Some commands can not be used while a live stream is playing, to use these commands you will have to wait until the live stream ends or skip the live stream.
